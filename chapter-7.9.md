# Chapter 7.9: Schema Version Control

Effective version control is vital for schema development, especially in collaborative game development environments. This section explores strategies for managing schema versions in source control systems, tracking changes, and maintaining compatibility across versions.

## Schema Versioning Strategies

Effective schema versioning requires a clear strategy:

1. **Semantic Versioning**: Using major.minor.patch format
2. **Version Metadata**: Embedding version info in schema files
3. **Compatibility Markers**: Indicating backward compatibility
4. **Deprecation Paths**: Gracefully phasing out old schemas
5. **Version Documentation**: Explaining changes between versions

The document [`schema_versioning_strategy.md`](code_samples/schema_versioning_strategy.md) outlines a comprehensive approach to schema versioning. This strategy helps teams manage schema evolution in a predictable way.

## Source Control Best Practices

Schemas benefit from specific source control practices:

1. Dedicated repository or subdirectory for schemas
2. Branch protection for schema main branch
3. Pull request templates for schema changes
4. Required reviews for schema modifications
5. Automated validation on schema commits

The code sample [`schema_git_hooks.py`](code_samples/schema_git_hooks.py) demonstrates Git hooks for schema validation. These hooks ensure that schema changes meet quality standards before being committed.

## Change Tracking

Detailed change tracking helps teams understand schema evolution:

1. Explicit schema changelog maintenance
2. Generated diff reports for schema changes
3. Visual diff tools for schema comparison
4. Property-level change tracking
5. Dependency impact analysis

The code sample [`schema_diff_tool.py`](code_samples/schema_diff_tool.py) demonstrates a tool for comparing schema versions. This implementation helps users understand what changed between versions.

## Branching Strategies

Different branching models suit different schema development needs:

1. **Feature Branching**: Creating branches for new schema features
2. **Release Branching**: Stabilizing schemas for specific releases
3. **Development/Stable**: Maintaining separate development and stable branches
4. **Long-term Support**: Maintaining compatibility branches for older versions
5. **Experimental Branches**: Isolating experimental schema changes

The document [`schema_branching_models.md`](code_samples/schema_branching_models.md) explores different branching strategies for schema development. This document helps teams choose the right strategy for their workflow.

## Schema Tagging and Releases

Formal releases help communicate schema stability:

1. Version tagging in source control
2. Release notes for each version
3. Pre-release designation for testing
4. Release candidate process
5. Deployment packages for schema releases

The code sample [`schema_release_tools.py`](code_samples/schema_release_tools.py) demonstrates tools for preparing and tagging schema releases. This implementation helps teams create formal releases of their schemas.

## Migration Scripts

Migration scripts help update assets between schema versions:

1. Automated property mapping
2. Default value updates
3. Schema structure transformations
4. Validation after migration
5. Rollback capabilities

The code sample [`schema_migration_generator.py`](code_samples/schema_migration_generator.py) demonstrates a tool for generating migration scripts between schema versions. This implementation helps automate the process of updating assets when schemas change.

## Schema Registry

A schema registry tracks available schema versions:

1. Centralized schema version catalog
2. Compatibility matrices between versions
3. Download links for specific versions
4. Documentation links for each version
5. Usage analytics for version adoption

The code sample [`schema_registry_service.py`](code_samples/schema_registry_service.py) demonstrates a web service for tracking schema versions. This implementation helps teams manage multiple schema versions across a project.

## Dependency Management

Schemas often have dependencies that must be managed:

1. Explicit dependency declaration
2. Version range specifications
3. Dependency conflict resolution
4. Minimal dependency principle
5. Dependency visualization

The code sample [`schema_dependency_analyzer.py`](code_samples/schema_dependency_analyzer.py) demonstrates a tool for analyzing schema dependencies. This implementation helps teams understand and manage relationships between schemas.

## Backward Compatibility Guidelines

Maintaining backward compatibility requires discipline:

1. Never remove properties, only deprecate them
2. Don't change property types
3. Use additive changes rather than modifications
4. Maintain fallbacks for new required properties
5. Document deprecation clearly

The document [`schema_compatibility_guidelines.md`](code_samples/schema_compatibility_guidelines.md) provides detailed guidelines for maintaining backward compatibility. These guidelines help teams evolve schemas without breaking existing assets.

## Breaking Change Management

Sometimes breaking changes are unavoidable:

1. Clear communication of breaking changes
2. Versioning that reflects breaking changes
3. Comprehensive migration tools
4. Extended transition periods
5. Parallel support for old and new versions

The document [`schema_breaking_change_protocol.md`](code_samples/schema_breaking_change_protocol.md) outlines a protocol for managing breaking changes. This protocol helps minimize disruption when incompatible changes are necessary.

## Key Takeaways

- Clear versioning strategies improve schema management
- Source control practices should be tailored to schema needs
- Detailed change tracking helps teams understand evolution
- Appropriate branching models depend on team workflows
- Formal releases communicate schema stability
- Migration scripts automate asset updates
- Schema registries track available versions
- Dependency management prevents conflicts
- Backward compatibility requires careful discipline
- Breaking changes need special handling

By implementing effective version control practices for schemas, teams can evolve their data models while maintaining stability for production assets. Careful versioning and migration strategies enable both innovation and reliability in game development pipelines.
