# Chapter 6.4: Runtime Optimization Techniques

Game engines require highly optimized runtime performance to maintain target frame rates. This section explores techniques for optimizing schema performance at runtime, focusing on precomputation, flattening, and specialized access patterns.

## Precomputed Schema Resolution

Precomputing schema resolution results at load time avoids runtime costs:

1. **Schema Layout Caching**: Precompute and cache schema layouts
2. **Property Value Preloading**: Preload commonly accessed property values
3. **Type Hierarchy Flattening**: Precompute flattened type hierarchies
4. **Applied Schema Indexing**: Build indices of which schemas are applied to which prims
5. **Access Pattern Optimization**: Optimize for common access patterns

The code sample [`precomputed_schema_resolver.h`](code_samples/precomputed_schema_resolver.h) demonstrates a system that precomputes schema resolution information:

- Caches schema type information and property layouts
- Preloads frequently accessed property values
- Flattens inheritance hierarchies for faster traversal
- Builds indices for fast schema lookup
- Optimizes for game-specific access patterns

This precomputation approach frontloads schema resolution costs to load time, reducing runtime overhead.

## Schema-Based Scene Traversal Optimization

Optimizing scene traversal based on schema structure improves performance:

1. **Schema-Specific Traversal Paths**: Build optimized traversal paths by schema type
2. **Purpose-Based Filtering**: Filter traversal by purpose
3. **Component-Based Pruning**: Prune traversal based on component requirements
4. **Spatial Optimization**: Combine schema filtering with spatial structures
5. **Traversal Caching**: Cache traversal results for repeat operations

The code sample [`schema_traversal_optimizer.h`](code_samples/schema_traversal_optimizer.h) demonstrates schema-based traversal optimization:

- Builds traversal paths optimized for specific schema types
- Implements purpose-based filtering to skip irrelevant prims
- Prunes traversal based on component requirements
- Integrates with spatial structures for localized queries
- Caches traversal results for frequently repeated operations

These optimized traversal techniques can dramatically reduce the cost of scene iteration, especially in large scenes with diverse schema application.

## Game-Specific Stage Flattening

Flattening USD stages for runtime efficiency reduces composition costs:

1. **Schema-Focused Flattening**: Flatten only schema-relevant aspects
2. **Purpose-Driven Population Masks**: Use population masks to limit stage content
3. **Game-Specific Layer Offsets**: Apply game-specific time offsets
4. **Selective Path Pruning**: Remove paths irrelevant to gameplay
5. **Namespace Optimization**: Optimize namespaces for runtime efficiency

The code sample [`game_stage_flattener.h`](code_samples/game_stage_flattener.h) demonstrates game-specific stage flattening:

- Focuses flattening on gameplay-relevant schemas
- Uses population masks to limit stage content
- Applies appropriate layer offsets for game time
- Prunes paths irrelevant to gameplay
- Optimizes namespaces for efficient runtime access

This flattening approach creates streamlined stages optimized for runtime gameplay needs, removing the overhead of full USD composition.

## Schema-Based Instancing

Schema-based instancing shares data for similar entities:

1. **Property Data Sharing**: Share property data between similar instances
2. **Schema Template Instances**: Create instances from schema templates
3. **Default Value Optimization**: Use default values instead of instance values
4. **Schema-Based Point Instancing**: Use schema data with point instancing
5. **LOD-Aware Instancing**: Vary instancing based on LOD level

The code sample [`schema_instancing_system.h`](code_samples/schema_instancing_system.h) demonstrates schema-based instancing:

- Shares property data between similar entities
- Creates optimized instances from templates
- Uses default values to reduce per-instance data
- Integrates with point instancing for massive populations
- Varies instancing approach based on LOD level

This instancing approach can dramatically reduce memory usage and improve performance for scenes with many similar entities.

## Custom Schema Resolvers

Custom schema resolvers optimize resolution for specific game needs:

1. **Game-Specific Property Resolution**: Optimize property resolution for game patterns
2. **Schema Override Resolution**: Customize override resolution for game schemas
3. **Cached Value Resolution**: Cache resolution results for repeat access
4. **Default Value Optimization**: Optimize default value handling
5. **Resolution Shortcutting**: Provide shortcuts for common resolution patterns

The code sample [`game_schema_resolver.h`](code_samples/game_schema_resolver.h) demonstrates a custom schema resolver:

- Optimizes property resolution for game-specific patterns
- Provides custom override resolution tailored to game schemas
- Caches resolution results for repeated access
- Optimizes default value handling
- Implements shortcuts for common resolution patterns

This custom resolution approach can significantly improve performance by tailoring the resolution process to specific game needs.

## Multi-Threaded Schema Processing

Multi-threaded processing leverages modern CPU architectures:

1. **Parallel Property Updates**: Update multiple properties in parallel
2. **Entity Batch Processing**: Process entity batches in parallel
3. **System-Based Parallelism**: Process different systems in parallel
4. **Work Stealing Queues**: Balance schema processing workloads
5. **Thread-Local Caching**: Use thread-local caches to reduce contention

The code sample [`threaded_schema_processor.h`](code_samples/threaded_schema_processor.h) demonstrates multi-threaded schema processing:

- Updates properties in parallel across multiple threads
- Processes entity batches in thread pools
- Executes different systems in parallel
- Implements work stealing for balanced workloads
- Uses thread-local caches to reduce synchronization overhead

This multi-threaded approach can significantly improve performance on multi-core systems, particularly for large scenes with many entities.

## Memory-Optimized Schema Storage

Memory-optimized storage reduces the overhead of schema data:

1. **Custom Memory Pools**: Use schema-specific memory pools
2. **Packed Property Storage**: Pack properties efficiently in memory
3. **Shared String Tables**: Use string table references instead of full strings
4. **Bitfield Optimization**: Use bitfields for boolean and flag properties
5. **Type-Specific Compression**: Apply specialized compression to different property types

The code sample [`schema_memory_optimizer.h`](code_samples/schema_memory_optimizer.h) demonstrates memory-optimized schema storage:

- Implements schema-specific memory pools
- Packs properties efficiently to reduce memory footprint
- Uses shared string tables for token values
- Optimizes boolean and flag properties with bitfields
- Applies type-specific compression to different property types

This memory optimization approach can significantly reduce the memory footprint of schema data, improving cache efficiency and reducing memory pressure.

## Case Study: Boss Battle Optimization

To illustrate runtime optimization techniques in a real-world scenario, consider a boss battle in our game:

1. **Challenge**: Complex boss with multiple phases, effects, and mechanics

   - Applied schema-based instancing for particle effects
   - Used multi-threaded processing for boss mechanics
   - Optimized memory layout for frequently accessed properties
3. **Results**: Maintained 60 FPS during intense boss fights with complex mechanics and effects

This case study demonstrates how targeted runtime optimizations can enable complex gameplay while maintaining performance targets.
