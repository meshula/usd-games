# Chapter 7: Team Workflows

## Collaborative Schema Development in Game Teams

Creating effective schemas is only part of the challenge. Enabling multiple disciplines to collaborate around these schemas requires thoughtful workflows and tools. This chapter explores strategies for artist-friendly schema authoring, cross-discipline collaboration, validation, and continuous integration.

This chapter is divided into several sections:

### Artist-Friendly Schema Authoring
1. [GUI Schema Editors](chapter-7.1.md) - Creating visual tools for schema creation 
2. [DCC Integration](chapter-7.2.md) - Integration with modeling and level design tools
3. [Visual Schema Feedback](chapter-7.3.md) - Providing visual indicators in DCC tools

### Designer-Programmer Collaboration
4. [Schema Definition Workflow](chapter-7.4.md) - Structured processes for collaborative schema creation
5. [Schema Request System](chapter-7.5.md) - Formal systems for requesting schema changes
6. [Prototype-to-Production Pipeline](chapter-7.6.md) - Moving schemas from prototype to production

### QA and Validation
7. [Schema Validators](chapter-7.7.md) - Tools for validating schema correctness
8. [Automated Schema Testing](chapter-7.8.md) - Automated tests for schema integrity

### CI/CD Integration
9. [Schema Version Control](chapter-7.9.md) - Strategies for schema versioning in VCS
10. [Continuous Integration](chapter-7.10.md) - Automating schema validation in CI pipelines
11. [Deployment Strategies](chapter-7.11.md) - Methods for deploying schemas across teams

Each section addresses a key aspect of enabling teams to work efficiently with codeless schemas in production. Code samples referenced in these chapters are available in the accompanying `code_samples` directory.
