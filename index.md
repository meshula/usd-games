## Code Samples

All code samples referenced in this guide are available in the accompanying `code_samples` directory. These samples provide practical implementations of the concepts discussed in the text and can be adapted to your specific workflow needs.

## About This Guide

This guide is designed for technical directors, pipeline engineers, and game developers who are integrating USD into their workflows. It focuses specifically on solving the schema deployment challenge that arises when working across multiple digital content creation tools and runtime platforms.

By leveraging codeless schemas, game studios can create flexible, adaptable game data models that travel with the assets themselves rather than requiring compiled plugins at each stage of the pipeline.
