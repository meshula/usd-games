# USD LOD Demo Project Plan

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates advanced Level of Detail (LOD) concepts using USD composition as detailed in Chapter 3.2: "Advanced LOD Through Composition". The demo will showcase various LOD techniques using Python with OpenUSD and Raylib for rendering.

## Goals

1. Create an interactive demonstration of USD-based LOD techniques
2. Implement examples from Chapter 3.2 as working demos
3. Provide educational value through clear visualization of LOD concepts
4. Show how USD composition can be used for advanced LOD beyond geometry

## Technical Approach

Since OpenEXR Core doesn't include Hydra rendering, we'll use Raylib to visualize USD scenes. The visualization will use simplified representations (boxes, spheres, text) to clearly illustrate different LOD states and systems.

### Implementation Strategy

1. **USD Integration**:
   - Create USD stages with appropriate schemas
   - Manipulate USD stages based on user input and LOD parameters
   - Read back USD data for visualization

2. **Visualization**:
   - Use Raylib for rendering simple 3D representations of USD scenes
   - Color-code different systems and components
   - Provide text labels showing current LOD states

3. **Interaction**:
   - Allow camera movement to test distance-based LOD
   - Provide UI controls to manually adjust LOD parameters
   - Enable selection between different demo scenarios

## Demo Scenarios

### 1. Variant-Based LOD
Demonstrate how variants can switch between different detail levels of entire subsystems.

### 2. Payload-Based LOD
Show dynamic loading/unloading of content using USD payloads based on distance.

### 3. Active Metadata LOD
Display toggling of subsystems using the USD 'active' metadata.

### 4. Behavioral LOD
Demonstrate LOD for AI/behavior systems using USD composition.

### 5. Physics LOD
Show different levels of physics simulation based on distance.

### 6. Castle Demo
Implement the complete castle example from the chapter with comprehensive LOD across multiple systems.
